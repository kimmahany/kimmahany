<h1>Kim Mahany's User Page</h1>
<p>
  My name is Kimberly Mahany and I am currently a sophomore here at the
  University of Oregon! During quarantine I've been enjoying watching funny Tik
  Toks, playing the Sims 4, binge watching Netflix, and treating my dog like my
  child.

    <h2>UO CIT Minor</h2>
    <p>
      The computer science department offers a Computer and Information
      Technology (CIT) minor, which emphasizes open-source technology and
      computing skills such as web development, networks, database programming
      and cloud computing. Read more about the CIT minor at cs.uoregon.edu.

    <h2>What the CIT Minor is About</h2>
    <p>
      From logical thought to programming, database concepts to website
      architecture, information privacy and security to networking and
      multimedia, the CIT minor is designed to help you understand how
      Information and Web technologies can be used to transform information in
      your own field of study. The CIT minor uses open-source web technologies,
      networks, databases and cloud-computing to create, store, transmit and
      publish content on the world wide web, and cloud servers. In the first
      year of the minor students learn IT concepts (such as networks, databases,
      and the WWW), and become skilled in using both basic and advanced web
      technologies (HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, jQuery, React, etc.). In the
      second year of the minor, students study the following topics: database
      design, webDev frameworks, computer networks & cyber-security.
